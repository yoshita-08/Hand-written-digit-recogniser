## üìë Brief Project Report  

**Title:** Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks  

**Objective:**  
To build a deep learning model capable of classifying handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) with high accuracy, using the MNIST dataset.  

**Methodology:**  
1. Loaded the MNIST dataset (60,000 training + 10,000 test images).  
2. Preprocessed data by normalizing pixel values and one-hot encoding labels.  
3. Designed a CNN with convolution, pooling, and dense layers.  
4. Trained the model for 5 epochs with the Adam optimizer.  
5. Evaluated performance on the test dataset and visualized predictions.  

**Results:**  
- The CNN achieved **~98% test accuracy**.  
- Successfully predicted digits on unseen test images.  
- Demonstrated robust performance on digit classification tasks.  

**Conclusion:**  
This project highlights the effectiveness of **CNNs in computer vision tasks**. Even with a simple architecture, the model reaches near state-of-the-art performance on MNIST. It can be extended to real-world handwritten digit applications and deployed in interactive systems.
